          <p>One of the backbone technologies we use at
            <a href='https://redpencil.io/'>redpencil.io</a>
            is SPARQL, a W3C standard designed for querying RDF graphs. It is
            the main way in which we interact with data, and we firmly believe
            that having a good grasp of how it works, whether you are a
            technical person or not, will be very helpful! For that reason,
            we've written this tutorial to guide you through SPARQL, it's
            syntax, subtleties, and everything in between.</p>

          <p>
            This tutorial is fully interactive from your web browser. We use
            <a href='https://triply.cc/docs/yasgui'>Yasgui</a>
            to interact with our SPARQL data, each exercise has an embedded
            console you can use to query our data. The code for this tutorial is
            hosted
            <a>here</a>, so if you prefer you can run it on your own machine.

          <p>
            Before jumping into the how of SPARQL, let's take a look at the why
            of SPARQL. And there's no better way to answer that than to look at
            the underlying data we'll be querying. Why query if you do not know
            what you'll be querying?
          </p>
          <p>SPARQL stands for
            <strong class="font-bold">SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language</strong>
            (yay recursive acronyms!). As you can see, it's a query language for
            RDF, but what is RDF itself? RDF is the Resource Description
            Framework, and it's a method for describing or modelling data. In
            this data model, your data is represented as three-statement facts.
            These facts, called triples, consist of a subject, a predicate and
            an object. The subject represents a resource, the predicate is the
            name of a property that the resource has, and the object is the
            value of said property. Resources are instances of classes, objects
            can be instances of classes as well, or they can be literals (like
            numbers, strings, etc.).</p>

      <Exercise
        @sparqlEndpoint='http://sparql-demo.s.redpencil.io:8890/sparql'
        @validQuery='SELECT DISTINCT ?type
WHERE {
  ?s rdf:type ?type .
}'
      >
        <h2 class='text-xl font-bold'>What types are defined in our endpoint?</h2>
        <p>Let's start off with an exploration of the data in our endpoint.
          Write a query that lists all the different available types.</p>
        <Hint>
          SPARQL has a shorthand notation for
          <code>rdf:type</code>, namely
          <code>a</code>.
