  <h3><code>CONSTRUCT</code> Query</h3>
</header>

<p>
  The
  <code>CONSTRUCT</code>
  query serves to create RDF graphs based on the provided patterns. This can be
  useful to reshape a part of your data for further processing. Aside from the
  <code>WHERE</code>
  block, which behaves in the same way as the previous two query types, you must
  also define how your new RDF graph should be structured using triples.

  Let's say that we'd like to have a graph of all artists that have collaborated
  on a track together. We notice that this relation is missing in our dataset,
  but we do have the information about who worked on which track. What we could
  do with this information is create a new graph where all artists who have
  worked on the same track are related using the property
  <code>mo:collaborated_with</code>. This could be done using the
  <code>CONSTRUCT</code>
  query below

{{!-- <pre><code>PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;

CONSTRUCT {
  ?artist mo:collaborated_with ?otherArtist .
}
WHERE {
  ?record a mo:Record.
  ?record mo:track ?track .
  ?artist a ?track .
  ?otherArtist foaf:made ?track .
  FILTER (?artist != ?otherArtist) .

<p>
  Note the new
  <code>FILTER</code>
  syntax. This operation allows us to add extra constraints to the value of our
  variables. We will be discuss this language feature more in-depth later, but
  for now know that it can be used to filter out triples from your dataset.

    Let's construct a graph of artists that have collaborated on a work. Use the
    <code>CONSTRUCT</code>
    query to create such a graph. You will want to use
    <code>LIMIT 100</code>
    to limit the running time of the query. Simple write
    <code>LIMIT 100</code>
    after the closing brace of your query.
  </p>
  <Hint>
    You can determine that two artists worked together on a song, album, ... if
    they both have a
    <code>foaf:made</code>
    property with the same work as it's value.
